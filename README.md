<h1>WoW API Usage</h1>

This is a collection of random code I created when playing with the WoW API.

<h3>Example API URL</h3>
http://us.battle.net/api/wow/character/uther/Gor?fields=pets,achievements,reputation

This will return JSON for the character Gor on Uther. It will return some basic data along with data for the specified fields, which are pets, achievements and reputation in this case.

<h3>Notes</h3>

Since my main purpose here was to get and manipulate data, I put very little effort into presentation.

This repo uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, LESS and Node JS.
